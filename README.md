## 👋 HellO There! Let's Dive Into the World of Ideas 🚀

Hey, folks! I'm **Himanshu Rajak**, your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast. When I'm not busy solving DSA problems or training models that make computers *a tad bit smarter*, you’ll find me diving deep into the realms of **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.  

Here’s the fun part: I’m totally obsessed with exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI** (yes, those mind-blowing AI that can create art, text, and maybe even jokes one day 🤖), and **Quantum Computing** (because who doesn’t love qubits doing magical things?).  

But wait, there's more! I’m also super passionate about publishing research papers and sharing my nerdy findings with the world. If you’re a fellow explorer or just someone who loves discussing tech, memes, or AI breakthroughs, let’s connect!

- **Medium**: [Himanshu Rajak](https://himanshusurendrarajak.medium.com/) (Where I pen my thoughts and experiments 🖋️)

Let’s team up and create something epic. Whether it’s about **generative algorithms** or **quantum wizardry**, I’m all ears—and ideas!  
🎯 Ping me, let’s innovate, and maybe grab some virtual coffee. ☕✨
